# Midterm-Take-Home

  This graph has the shape of a logarithmic function, however it is broken up
into pieces and each step gets longer and longer as the maximum value gets 
higher. Because the maximum value gets higher the sequence length stays the
same since the value before doesn't reach the max value. Once it reaches the
maximum sequence it levels out and reaches a maximum it stops the length of
sequence. But at the smaller values of the sequence it increases faster.
